# Cross-Chain-Rebase-Token
1. This project is about to create a cross-chain rebase token and will be using **CCIP**.


## key points
1. A protocol that allows users to deposit into a vault and in return, receive rebase tokens that represent their underlying balance.
2. The rebase token's balance of function is dynamic to show the changing balance with time.
3. The protocol sets an interest rate for each user based on some global interest rate of the protocol at the time the user deposits into the vault.
